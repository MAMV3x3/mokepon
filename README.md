Web multiplayer game using Node.js

A web multiplayer game using Node.js and React utilizing the power of Node.js as the server-side technology to handle game logic and real-time communication between players, and React as the front-end library for building the user interface. The game uses WebSocket to enable real-time communication between players and the server. This would allow for fast and responsive gameplay, allowing players to interact with each other in real-time. On the server-side, Node.js is used to handle game logic such as player movement, collision detection, and scoring. It would also be responsible for managing the real-time communication between players, ensuring that all players are in sync with each other. On the client-side, React is used to build the user interface, which would include the game board, player avatars, and various buttons and controls. React's component-based architecture would make it easy to build a modular and reusable user interface, which would help to keep the codebase maintainable.
